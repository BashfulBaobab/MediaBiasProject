# MediaBiasProject
A project to analyze if there is an inherent bias in print media


## Goal
The idea was to identify if there is a bias in the way these media sources are printing stories about the COVID-19 vaccines. We found some surprising results.

## Data Used
Data was collected from 5 sources of print media:
* Fox News
* CNN
* Breitbart
* Reuters
* HuffPost

Tweets on the articles used were also collected, and can be found in the tweet_locations.zip file

## Process
* Scrape data from individual websites for article data
* Scrape data from twitter for details on tweets for/against the articles in question
* Data Cleaning and Preprocessing
* Lift analysis for words used
* Sentiment analysis using VADER

## Results
